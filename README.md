# Introduction

This library provides an elegant form for credit card entry that can be easily added to a activity or fragment.
Regex is used to validate credit card types and a Luhn check is performed on the card numbers. This form was inspired by the credit entry UI on Square.

 - Smooth interface
 - Identifies credit card type
 - Hides number for privacy
 - Supports VISA, MasterCard, Discover and AMEX

# Including in your project

This project uses [JitPack](https://jitpack.io) to build and release.

Add JitPack to the end of your `repositories`

```
    repositories {

        ...

        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
```

Add the project to your `dependencies`

```
    dependencies {

        ...

        compile 'com.github.jgrana:CreditCardEntry:1.0.1'
    }
```

# Using the library

Please see below for an example. Delegate calls for valid entry and accessors for the data will be added in future updates.
Adding the form is simply as seen below, or it can be added through an Android layout file.

    public class MainActivity extends Activity {
  
      private LinearLayout linearLayout;
      private CreditCardForm form;
  
      protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
  
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
    	linearLayout = (LinearLayout) findViewById(R.id.layer);
		
        form = new CreditCardForm(this);
    	linearLayout.addView(form);
    	
    	buttonAuthorize = (Button) findViewById(R.id.buttonAuthorize);
    	buttonAuthorize.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {
    		
    		@Override
    		public void onClick(View arg0) {
    			if(form.isCreditCardValid())
    			{
    				CreditCard card = form.getCreditCard();
    				//Pass credit card to service
    			}
    			else
    			{
    				//Alert Credit card invalid
    			}
    		}
    	});
    }
